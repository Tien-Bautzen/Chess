          occupying the e7-square itself). Thus, the total number of possible 
          moves for the rook in Diagram 5 is ten.

        <p>... and on a1, it would have no more than 7. Thus the bishop's 
          mobility is less than that of the rook, which on an open board always
          has 14 moves, no matter which square it is on.<br>
          Furthermore, the bishop operates on squares of one colour only – the 
          light squares or the dark squares (hence we use the expressions 
          "light-squared bishop" and "dark-squared bishop"), whereas all the 
          squares on the board, irrespective of colour, are accessible to the
          rook's action.<br>
          This goes to show that the rook is stronger than the bishop.

          <i>and</i> a bishop. On an open board it has a choice of 27 moves from 
          any of the centre squares.<br>
          Thanks to its immense mobility and also to its option to making 
          diagonal moves on either the light or the dark squares, the queen
          proves to be a good deal stronger than a rook and a bishop combined.

        <h3>Commentary for Diagram 8</h3>
        <p>In this diagram, eight queens are placed in such a way that not one 
          of them is within capturing range of another. In 1862, Carl Jaenisch
          proved that 92 such configurations are possible. From the solutions he 
          gave, we have selected the one that is simplest in outward appearance.

        <h3>Solution to Diagram 8</h3>
        <p>The eight queens puzzle is the problem of placing eight chess queens 
          on an 8×8 chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other; thus, 
          a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or 
          diagonal.<br>
          The eight queens puzzle has 92 distinct solutions. If solutions that 
          differ only by the symmetry operations of rotation and reflection of 
          the board are counted as one, the puzzle has 12 solutions. These are 
          called <i>fundamental solutions</i>.<br>
          A fundamental solution usually has eight variants (including its 
          original form) obtained by rotating 90, 180, or 270° and then 
          reflecting each of the four rotational variants in a mirror in a fixed
           position. However, one of the 12 fundamental solutions is identical 
           to its own 180° rotation, so has only four variants (itself and its 
           reflection, its 90° rotation and the reflection of that). Thus, the 
           total number of distinct solutions is 11×8 + 1×4 = 92.<br>
           The solution shown here is a mirror image of Diagram 8 obtained by
           reflection.
